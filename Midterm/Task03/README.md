# FE 522 Spring 2019 Midterm Exam Task 3 (30 points)

Assume you are giving the task of swapping the values of two very large vectors (10 million elements each) 50 times in a row. The main functionality to accomplish this is already implemented in the main.cpp file for you:

1. (10 points) Modify the swapMethod02() function so that it executes faster and requires less memory to run in comparison to the swapMethod01() function. Test your modifications by compiling and running the code.

2. (10 points) Modify the main() function so that it outputs the time each function took to run to a file "result.txt" located in an "output" folder instead of outputing to the standard output stream (std::cout).

3. (10 points) Manually create a new "report.txt" file in your project, where you are supposed to explain the reasons why your modifications can improve both execution speed and memory usage.
