# FE 522 Spring 2019 Midterm Exam Task 1 (30 points)

Wikipedia: "A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as 'madam' or 'racecar' or the number 10801. Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as 'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!' or 'Was it a car or a cat I saw?'."

1. (15 points) Implement the isPalindrome() function using the definition above. It should return true if the sentence is a palindrome, and false if it is not. You can assume punctuations will not be present in your input.

2. (15 points) In your main() function, add at least six more examples of use of the isPalindrome() function: three palindromes and three non-palindromes. The function must have been correcly implemented.
